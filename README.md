frameworks-av
=============
This branch of the AV framework is integrating our DASH MPD parser and DRM interface for ASPIRE. It targets the Maguro platform (QCOM based) 
and the Tuna chipset around which is built the Galaxy Nexus.
Goal is to be able to demo ASPIRE on this phone (as a complement to the Nitrogen 6X board demo). This last is  in FSL-imx6 branch of the 
AV framework (as this board is based on FreeScale iMX6 SoC).

PS: I'll try to use the HW codec for DRM (OMXPlayer for FSL and QCOM Player for Maguro). Not sure it is possible (easily). 
